3 Types of Recommender Systems
    1. Content Based -- Recommend items similar to what the user has liked in the past
    2. Collaborative Filtering -- Recommend items based on what similar users have liked
    3. Hybrid Models -- Combine the above two methods to provide recommendations

Earlier, Youtube used Content based Recommendation system, but lately it has switched to Hybrid.
Startups either do Content based or Collaborative Filtering, but as they grow, they switch to Hybrid.

Why Hybrid?
    1. Content based systems are limited by the features of the items
    2. Collaborative Filtering systems are limited by the data available
    3. Hybrid systems can overcome these limitations

In this project, we will build a Content based Recommender System.
